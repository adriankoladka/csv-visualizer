Your task is to implement {{feature}} based on the context added to the conversation.
First, carefully review the context.
Second, carefully review the project structure and existing code. 
Pay special attention to the content of app directory in the project root and do not miss already prepared .py files.
For example, do not forget to review the code in app\auth\models.py.
Third, start implementation, following the approach defined below.

<implementation_approach>
Plan a maximum of 3 steps and briefly summarize them for me. At this point, wait for my feedback and do not take any action. If more context is required, ask for it.
After receiving my feedback, execute the planned steps and repeat the cycle.
