Your task is to implement {{feature}} based on the context added to the conversation.
First, carefully review the context.
Second, carefully review the project structure and existing code. 
This means that you must inspect every file you can find in the project which is relevant for implementation of {{feature}}
Pay special attention to .py files.
Do not assume upfront that a file is incomplete or that it acts as a placeholder - this is not always the case.
Third, start implementation, following the approach defined below.

<implementation_approach>
Plan a maximum of 3 steps and briefly summarize them for me. At this point, wait for my feedback and do not take any action. If more context is required, ask for it.
After receiving my feedback, execute the planned steps and repeat the cycle.
