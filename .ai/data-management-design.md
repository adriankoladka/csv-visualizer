# CsvVisualizer - Application Data Management Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the data management design for the CsvVisualizer application. The design is based on a session-based, non-persistent storage model, aligning with the project's MVP requirements. All user-uploaded data is stored temporarily on the server for the duration of an active session and is automatically purged upon session termination. This approach eliminates the need for a database, simplifying the architecture while ensuring user data privacy.

## 2. Directory Structure

A dedicated temporary directory will be used to store all uploaded files. To ensure data isolation between users, a unique subdirectory will be created for each user session.

-   **Main Upload Directory**: `instance/uploads/`
    -   This directory will be created within the Flask `instance` folder, which is designed for files not under version control.
    -   The web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) should be configured to deny direct HTTP access to this path.
-   **Session-Specific Directory**: `instance/uploads/<session_id>/`
    -   `<session_id>` will be a unique and securely generated identifier (e.g., using `uuid.uuid4().hex`).
    -   This unique directory is created when a user uploads their first file.
    -   All subsequent files for that session are stored here.

Example: `instance/uploads/b3a1c2d9f0e84a5ab7c6d5e4f3g2h1i0/my_data.csv`

## 3. Session Data Structure

Flask's secure session object (`flask.session`) will be the single source of truth for managing user file metadata. This avoids database dependency and keeps the state tied to the user's session.

The session will store:
1.  `session_dir_id`: The unique identifier (`<session_id>`) for the user's temporary directory.
2.  `files`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an uploaded file.

```python
# Example structure of flask.session
{
    'user_id': 123,
    'session_dir_id': 'b3a1c2d9f0e84a5ab7c6d5e4f3g2h1i0',
    'files': [
        {
            'id': 'file_1', # A unique identifier for the file within the session
            'original_filename': 'sales_data_q1.csv',
            'server_path': 'instance/uploads/b3a1c2d9f0e84a5ab7c6d5e4f3g2h1i0/sales_data_q1.csv'
        },
        {
            'id': 'file_2',
            'original_filename': 'customer_feedback.csv',
            'server_path': 'instance/uploads/b3a1c2d9f0e84a5ab7c6d5e4f3g2h1i0/customer_feedback.csv'
        }
    ]
}
```

A limit of **5 files per session** will be enforced at the application level to prevent resource exhaustion.

## 4. Core Components

### Data Management Blueprint (`data_bp`)

All data management logic will be encapsulated within a dedicated Flask blueprint to ensure modularity and separation of concerns.

-   **Blueprint Name**: `data`
-   **URL Prefix**: `/data`
-   **Responsibilities**:
    -   Handle file uploads, deletions, and updates.
    -   Provide endpoints for retrieving the list of uploaded files.

### Helper Functions

A set of utility functions will be created to manage file and directory operations cleanly.

-   `get_session_dir() -> Path`: Retrieves the path to the user's session directory. Creates it if it doesn't exist.
-   `clear_session_dir()`: Deletes the user's session directory and all its contents. This will be called on logout.
-   `is_valid_csv(file_stream) -> bool`: Checks if the uploaded file is a valid CSV with UTF-8 encoding and headers in the first row. It will use `pandas.read_csv()` within a `try-except` block to perform validation.

## 5. Workflow and Routes

### 5.1. File Upload

-   **Route**: `POST /data/upload`
-   **Workflow**:
    1.  The user submits a file via a form.
    2.  The application checks if the session file limit (5) has been reached. If so, return an error.
    3.  The file is read into memory to validate its format (CSV, UTF-8 encoding) using the `is_valid_csv` helper. An error is returned if validation fails.
    4.  The user-provided filename is sanitized using `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename()`.
    5.  The `get_session_dir()` helper is called to get/create the unique session directory.
    6.  The file is saved to the session directory.
    7.  A new file entry (dictionary) is added to the `session['files']` list.
    8.  The user is redirected to the dashboard, where the new file will appear in the list.

### 5.2. File Deletion

-   **Route**: `POST /data/delete/<file_id>`
-   **Workflow**:
    1.  The user clicks a "Delete" button, triggering a request to this endpoint with the unique `file_id`.
    2.  The application finds the file's metadata in `session['files']` using the `file_id`.
    3.  The physical file is deleted from the server using `os.remove()`.
    4.  The corresponding entry is removed from the `session['files']` list.
    5.  A confirmation message is flashed to the user.

### 5.3. File Update

-   **Route**: `POST /data/update/<file_id>`
-   **Workflow**:
    1.  The user clicks an "Update" button, which opens a file dialog. Upon selection, a form is submitted to this endpoint.
    2.  The new file is validated just like in the upload process.
    3.  The application finds the old file's metadata in `session['files']`.
    4.  The old physical file is deleted from the server.
    5.  The new file is saved to the session directory (potentially with a new sanitized name).
    6.  The entry in `session['files']` is updated with the new `original_filename` and `server_path`.
    7.  A confirmation message is flashed to the user.

### 5.4. File List Display

-   There is no dedicated route for this. The list of files will be retrieved directly from `session.get('files', [])` within the main dashboard/chart configuration route.
-   The template will iterate through this list to display the files, along with "Delete" and "Update" buttons for each.

## 6. Session Management and Data Cleanup

-   **Session Initialization**: The session directory is created lazily upon the first file upload, not on login. This prevents the creation of empty directories for users who don't upload anything.
-   **Session Teardown (Logout)**: When a user logs out, the following actions must be performed before the standard Flask-Login logout procedure:
    1.  Check if `session_dir_id` exists in the session.
    2.  If it exists, construct the path to the session directory.
    3.  Call a cleanup function (`clear_session_dir()`) that uses `shutil.rmtree()` to recursively and permanently delete the entire session directory and its contents.
    4.  Clear the `session['files']` and `session['session_dir_id']` keys.

This ensures that all user data is purged immediately upon logout, fulfilling requirement US-009.

## 7. Security Considerations

-   **Filename Sanitization**: All filenames from users will be processed with `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename()` to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
-   **Direct Access Prevention**: The `instance/uploads` directory will be configured at the web server level (e.g., via Nginx `location` block or Apache `.htaccess`) to block all direct HTTP requests, ensuring files can only be accessed through the application logic.
-   **Resource Limits**: The 5-file limit per session and 1MB file size limit protect against simple resource exhaustion attacks.
