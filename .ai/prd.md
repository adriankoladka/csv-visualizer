# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - CsvVisualizer

## 1. Product Overview
The CsvVisualizer is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to provide a simple, web-based interface for non-technical users to generate basic data visualizations from CSV files. Users can upload one or more CSV files, manage them in a session-based list, and select a file to generate a chart. For a selected file, users can choose data columns for the X and Y axes, pick a chart type (Bar, Line, or Scatter), and generate a static chart image. All uploaded data is processed within the user's session and is not stored persistently. The application focuses on simplicity and speed, allowing users to quickly create and download visualizations for presentations or reports without needing to use complex software.

## 2. User Problem
The CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format is a ubiquitous standard for storing and exchanging tabular data. However, in its raw text form, it is difficult for users to interpret, identify trends, or draw meaningful conclusions from the data. Existing data analysis tools are often powerful but come with a steep learning curve, making them inaccessible to users without a technical background who need to create simple visualizations quickly.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- 3.1. File Upload: A user interface for uploading CSV files. Each uploaded file is added to the user's session list. The interface must clearly state the following constraints for each file:
  - Maximum file size: 1MB
  - Delimiter: Comma-separated
  - Encoding: UTF-8
  - Structure: Headers must be in the first row.
- 3.2. User Access Management: A system to manage user access, requiring users to log in to use the application.
- 3.3. Chart Configuration: After a file is selected from the user's session list, the user is presented with a dashboard containing:
  - A dropdown menu to select a column for the X-axis from the selected file.
  - A dropdown menu to select a column for the Y-axis from the selected file.
  - A dropdown menu to select a chart type from "Bar", "Line", or "Scatter".
- 3.4. Visualization Generation: A Python-based backend process that:
  - Reads the data from the uploaded CSV file.
  - Generates a chart image using a library like Matplotlib or Plotly based on the user's axis and chart type selections.
- 3.5. Chart Display and Download:
  - The generated chart image is displayed within the user's browser.
  - A "Download" button allows the user to save the generated chart as a PNG file.
- 3.6. Logging: The application must log two specific events to a local text file for metric tracking: `chart_generated` and `chart_downloaded`.
- 3.7. Data Management: A server-side process for managing uploaded data on a temporary basis.
  - Users can view a list of CSV files uploaded during their current session.
  - Users can delete files from this list.
  - Uploaded CSV files are stored in a temporary directory on the server only for the duration of the user's active session.
  - All temporary data associated with a session is automatically deleted upon user logout or session expiration.
  - This approach allows users to manage multiple datasets within a single session without requiring long-term data persistence.

## 4. Product Boundaries
The following features and functionalities are explicitly outside the scope of the MVP:
- Support for file formats other than CSV (e.g., JSON).
- Interactive visualizations (e.g., tooltips on hover, zooming).
- Generation of advanced or complex chart types (e.g., heatmaps).
- User-defined data transformation or cleaning capabilities within the application.
- Support for multiple simultaneous file uploads or datasets.
- Saving, storing, or managing previously uploaded files or generated charts for users. All user data is deleted at the end of a session.
- Persistent storage of user data, uploaded files, or generated charts across sessions.

## 6. Success Metrics
- Primary Success Criterion: 50% of all generated visualizations are downloaded by users.
- Measurement: The success of the MVP will be measured by tracking two key events. The application will log `chart_generated` every time a user generates a visualization and `chart_downloaded` every time a user downloads one. The success metric will be calculated as: (Total `chart_downloaded` events / Total `chart_generated` events) >= 0.5 over a specified time period.
