# Application - CsvVisualizer (MVP)

### Main problem
CSV file is a very common data storage format, but in its raw form, it is often difficult to read and it is hard to draw conclusions from data presented in such manner.

### Minimal set of functionalities
- Users are able to upload their CSV files
- Data contained in the CSV files can be read and transformed
- Basic visualizations (example: bar charts) can be generated from the CSV data
- Generated visualizations can be downloaded as images by the users

### What is OUTSIDE of MVP scope
- Support for file formats other than CSV
- User interaction with generated visualizations
- Generation of more advanced visualizations (example: histograms)

### Success criteria
- 50% of generated visualizations were downloaded by the users
